This is a annotation converter for android library

Chinese version is [here](https://github.com/yunair/annotationbox/blob/master/README-CN.md)

# Getting Start

Add annotationbox-plugin as a dependency in your main build.gradle in the root of your project:

~~~ gradle
buildscript {
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.air:annotationbox-plugin:0.5'
    }
}
~~~

apply the plugin and assign origin annotation and target annotation to your app/build.gradle

such as below:

~~~ gradle
apply plugin: 'com.air.annotationbox'

annotationbox {
    ruleMaps = [
            "com.air.annotationbox.custom.annotations.AGET":"retrofit2.http.GET",
            "com.air.annotationbox.custom.annotations.AHeaders":"retrofit2.http.Headers",
    ]
}
~~~

Then, when you build app, you will find every annotations as ruleMaps key will convert to ruleMaps valueã€‚

This will help you encapsulate annotation.

When the third party library update version and change the annotation package name,
This will help you ignore this effect.


# Known Issues

There are some issues:
1. Only support annotation in interface. So, like butterknife annotation is not support
